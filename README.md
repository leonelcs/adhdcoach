## üóÑÔ∏è Local Database Setup (MySQL with Docker)

Follow these steps to set up your local MySQL database for this project:

### 4.1.1. Start MySQL with Docker

Make sure you have Docker installed. Then, from the project root, run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a MySQL server with the correct user, password, and database as defined in your `.env.local`.

---

### 4.1.2. Connect to the MySQL Container as Root

```sh
docker exec -it adhdcoach-mysql mysql -u root -p
```
Enter the root password (`rootpassword` as set in `docker-compose.yml`).

---

### 4.1.3. Create Database and User (if not already created)

Inside the MySQL prompt, run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS adhd_coach;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'adhdcoach'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'My:S3cr3t';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'adhdcoach'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

---

### 4.1.4. Test the Connection

From your host machine, test the connection:

```sh
mysql -u adhdcoach -pMy:S3cr3t -h 127.0.0.1 -P 30306 adhd_coach
```

---

### 4.1.5. Run Prisma Migrations

Back in your project directory, run:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will create the necessary tables as defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

---

**Now your local database is ready for development!**



### 5. Run Prisma migrations

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will create the necessary tables in your MySQL database.

### 6. Start the development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app.

---

## Useful Commands

- Open Prisma Studio (DB GUI):  
  ```sh
  npx prisma studio
  ```
- Generate Prisma client:  
  ```sh
  npx prisma generate
  ```

---

## Notes

- You need valid Google OAuth credentials and a Todoist API token to use all features.
- The app will automatically create a user in the database on first login.
- All user and token data is stored in MySQL via Prisma.
